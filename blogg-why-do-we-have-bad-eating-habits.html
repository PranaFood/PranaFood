<p>Publicerat: 2013-10-12</p>
<p>Welcome to my new blog about children's and adults' health.</p>
<p>Returning home after some time in the Middle East and as father to my wonderful daughter Mimmi who is now 1.5 years old soon, I devoted much time to find the "right" food for my daughter.</p>
<p>On the verge of being branded a nerd, I have scanned every baby food jar, label and contents I came over. One can easily believe that all baby food is quite OK, but personally as food scientist , nutritionists and chef I suspect the kept a long time without refrigeration or freezer, for not mentioning the taste of the gruel and powder milk.</p>
<p>The hunt for the best food for Mimmi got me thinking about the habits the food we give our children can create for them already in childhood?</p>
<p>So I will start my blog with our most important source of nutrition namely the food we eat, the trends and habits around this.</p>
<p>Internet, media and books etc. meet us everywhere with advice and health advice nonetheless; many do not follow this advice. Anyone who knows me knows that I toured Scandinavia around and lectured on food, health and wellbeing. I meet all that often people who want to change their lifestyles but who cannot believe it is possible or simply lack real motivation to change their habits.</p>
<p>I eagerly asked myself why is that? And it is now over Mimmi as answers begin to fall into place.</p>
<p>Well at the kitchen table, Mimmi refuses to settle for her mash or puree. She refuses to drink the bottle and want of course to drink out of our glasses. It is almost impossible to get her to sit in her baby seat. She run to sit on a regular chair as we do. She gobbles down peanuts and Voltaire Berry Boost, which I also have as personal favorite. Early the need to belong and become one of the flock forms within us.  Early encodes the tastes and habits that children will mostly appreciate for many years to come.</p>
<p>Good and bad habits shape us day after day. It's the same story with cigarettes. Everyone knows that it is dangerous, yet young people, particularly young girls start smoking. It may be the revolt against the adult world or the thought:” it does not affect me, I can stop whenever I want, a cig a day cannot hurt, doesn´t matter if I die a year before the main thing that I'm enjoying the moment! I feel good to smoke, feel calm”, etc ... These and many other reasons are the ones I have heard when talking about heath with high school students.</p>
<p>But really, it's all that about only one thing - to be loved! And through others love yourself ... or at least feel connected to others and thus approved,” I'm OK as a person." Because if the group you want to feel connected to not smoke then yourself rarely start smoking.</p>
<p>Same with alcohol and drugs, as well as the food we eat. Food has always been a way for us to know and form community. What we've eaten during childhood puts in many references for what food we appreciate. Mom's cooking, or grandma's recipe describes the emotional relationship we attach to food. But above all, what habits we both physically and emotionally get for food. E.g. if we are served liver as young, we mostly like it. But if we never ate it as kids, we will probably never appreciate it as growing up.</p>
<p>But the eating habits that my audience gather strength and courage to break is not what belongs to our food traditions meaning dishes that we usually only eat at specific feasts. I rather mean of course the eating habits that are linked to overconsumption of certain food that we eat on a daily basis. In some cases, people forget that they are subject to those habits.</p>
<p>Therefore, before we talk about breaking those habits for a healthier life, I will by tomorrow blog briefly remind you how trends form new habits.</p>
<p>See you then..</p>
